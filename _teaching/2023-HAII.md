In the spring semester of 2023, I taught the course Harmonic Analysis II.

Course description

In this course, we cover topics from the theory of A_p-weights, singular integrals, and Calder√≥n-Zygmund operators.

The course is a continuation of the course Harmonic Analysis I, which covers chapters 1-3 in Juha Kinnunen's lecture notes on Harmonic Analysis.
