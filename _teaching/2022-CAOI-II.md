In the fall semester of 2022, I served as the assistant for two courses on mathematical optimization taught by professor Xiao Zhong in Helsinki.

Course description
======

The course gives a pedestrian introduction to the mathematical theory of unconstrained optimization.

Personal involvement: I was in charge of the exercise classes and teaching students on how to use MATLAB to create optimization algorithms. I also gave an introductory series of lectures about neural networks during the exercise classes.
